There are two files here:
 - The Jupyter notebook (NeuroFlow Take-Home Part 1.ipynb) covers an analysis of the project data.  To run it requires the numpy, pandas, and matplotlib libraries, and requires that the data file be in the same folder.
 - The SQL file (queries.sql) lists the three queries that answer the three questions in the second part of the project.
